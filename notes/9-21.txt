g2
go in opposite direction of the average direction of all other cells


g6
go in opposite direction of the two closest cells

Michael: if the view radius is too large, the avoidance behavior might be overreacting too much in avoiding neighbors

Jingyu: farther away cells are more uniformly distributed and their average vector cancels out


g4
divide surrounding area into quadrants, go towards least populated quadrant


g8
cells move in a circle/square to defend territory. upon reproducing, the new cell is sent farther out before it begins circling
circling is not ideal at the beginning of the game because it restricts your territory unnecessarily

Xi: at the end of the game the crowded space prevents moving in a circle

Michael: circles are hard to implement because of potential inteference preventing the circle from being completed. But theoretically it's a good idea

Stephanie: clustering is a sign of success in using space efficiently at the beginning


g1
move in the opposite direction of nearby cells, but is not using pheromes.


g3
aggressive player that travels in S shapes towards other players.
aggressive strategies do not seem to work well, at least initially


g9
choose angle with most open space


g5
vector sum of nearby cells but went towards instead of away


d=7,t=1
aggressive strategies seem to be doing better

Rojan: clustering is better for larger n


for arbitrary choices (such as quadrant), you should provide theoretical or experimental justification as to why that particular parameter was chosen

player needs to internally handle different d,t parameters. can have different strategies, just need to all be unified into one player
