g3: treat large clump of cells as as single cell for the purposes of creating an average vector direction to move away from

g1: form circles based on length of t, spin around and refresh circles of pheromes

Julian: have trail of pheromes communicate to other cells of the same species

do not need to move 1mm with each step


g3,g5: use byte to store angle of movement. move away from cells

Julian: use byte to store side length of movement squares
Yishwan: store a countdown timer

Michael: take into account growth capability when moving

David: weight smaller cells less in vector-based movement straegies
also move away from friendly cells that are close to reproducing

Michael: direction of movement does not matter much, only number of cells and number of pheromes left behind to block other cells

Lou: pherome trails are parallel if cells share direction of movement. this gives opponent cells a free region in between to move

Yuan: remembering angle last moved in is important so that cells move quickly at the beginning

Martina: can mix straight lines with the circle strategy

Rajiv: straight line is good initially to spread out quickly, but not necessarily later on when space is more congested

Bruce: spreading out isn't necessarily the bes., as long as one can grow at the optimal rate pheromes can be used to carve out territory. spreading out only achieves optimal growth without considering territory
